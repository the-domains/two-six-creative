# A Designers' Cradle

It was basically love at first site. I walked into the room, it looked at me with those "come sit on me" eyes and it was over - I was gone - and I am staying forever. I'll leave work when I'm dead... 

Is this really our office you ask? Well, off course not. It's a studio. Who would want to work in a studio? Look how clean those desks? We're way too busy for a desk like that. But, we do have the same desks. And I would bet a much shorter walk to the coffee pot.
